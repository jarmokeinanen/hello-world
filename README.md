# hello-world
My first repository. Hello-world project.
I am quite new to Java. I hope to write some Java programs on GitHub and take part in open sorce projects, as a tester first. I study software testing, programming and web development.
I know the basics of software testing. Now I study software testing tool programs. I'm starting that with Robot Framework. When I know enough of it, I will look for an open source project to participate as a tester.
